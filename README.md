# Undergraduate_Final-Year-Project
Project Description:
During the pandemic of Covid-19, people all over the world have been
affected, ranging from ordinary people to organizations, geopolitical entities,
and entire countries. People have been expressing their sentiments about the
pandemic on Twitter which is an essential outlet for people to discuss their
feelings and opinions.
India is not an exception to this intimidating virus. The entire nation got
shattered, and there was a tremendous loss in the economy as people lost
their jobs, shops were closed, people were restricted from roaming outside
that leads to discontinue their business. Corporate companies implemented
work-from home system and education institutions moved to online class‚Äù. All
these changes made people use mobiles/PCs and social media intensively.
People started to express their thoughts as posts on social media platforms
such as Twitter. As a result, an enormous amount of data gets generated, and
the analysis of this data will benefit mankind.
